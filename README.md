## Build and Export to itch.io

- Create new project on itch.io
- Build the Godot project using HTML template
  - `echo .build/ >> .gitignore`
  - `rm -r .build && mkdir .build`
  - Project -> Export... -> Add Preset -> Web -> (if not already installed, download the HTML template) -> Set output path to `.build/` -> Export Project... -> filename `index.html` -> disable `Export with Debug` -> Export
    - or, as a command (once initial setup is done)
    - `/home/mirco/programming/gamedev/godot4/Godot_v4.1.3-stable_linux.x86_64 --export-release Web .build/index.html`
- upload the build to itch.io `/home/mirco/programming/gamedev/itchio-butler/butler push .build mkraenz/dwarves-of-mikraz:web`
- enable the build in the itch.io project page
- In itch.io, edit project -> Uploads -> enable `This file will be played in the browser`
- enable `SharedArrayBuffer support â€” (Experimental)`
  - Fixes error message on game load: `The following features required to run Godot projects on the Web are missing: ...`
  - Note: if you create the itch.io project and set SharedArrayBuffer support at that time, itch seems to forget your config for the newly uploaded build artifacts.

Release script

```sh
./shipit.sh
```

## Start game from command line

```sh
/home/mirco/programming/gamedev/godot4/Godot_v4.1.1-stable_linux.x86_64 .
```

### Features

#### Persistence

check `persistence.gd`. Note that JSON does not support `INF` so we added a custom parser `JSONX`. To persist floats that can be `INF` use `JSONX.stringify_float(my_float)`.

#### Pausing

following [docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/pausing_games.html)

summary:

- set the `root/Main/Gui/PauseMenu` node's `Process.mode` to `When Paused` (in code: `Node.PROCESS_MODE_PAUSABLE`)
- call `get_tree().paused = true # or false`
- `pause_menu.hide()`

## Data generation

We are using a data-driven approach to define items and crafting recipes. Corresponding files you need to change are the `.ts` files in `./assets/data/`. Then, simply run the export script to generate the corresponding json files that get automatically loaded into the game via `GData.gd`.

```sh
yarn datagen
```

## Deployment

Automatically bumps version, builds project, and pushes it to itch.io.

```sh
yarn deploy
```

## Learnings

- set the default theme via Project -> Theme (under GUI subheading) -> Custom -> select default theme
